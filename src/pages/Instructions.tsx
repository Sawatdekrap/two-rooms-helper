              In <i>Two Rooms and a Boom</i> there are{" "}
              <strong>2 teams and 2 rooms</strong>. The 2 teams are the Blue
              Team and the Red Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team
              has a Bomber. Players are first equally distributed between 2
              separate playing areas (usually 2 separate rooms) and then each
              player is randomly dealt a facedown character card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Players play the game by saying what they want in order to select
              a leader for their room. The leader chooses{" "}
              <strong>hostages</strong> (players who will be sent to the other
              room <strong>at the end of the round</strong>)
            </p>
            <p>
              . The game consists of <strong>3 timed rounds</strong> . Each
              round is shorter than the previous round. At the end of each
              round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be{" "}
              <strong>traded</strong> into opposing rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The game ends after the last hostage exchange.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone reveals their card. If Red Teamâ€™s Bomber is in the same
              room as the President, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue
              Team wins.
